## System Requirements

### Required
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Streamlink** - Stream handling and playback management
- **Selenium & Chrome WebDriver** - For session management and URL extraction
- **Video Player**: Either **MPV** (recommended) or **VLC**

### Platform Support
- Windows 10/11 (primary)
- Linux/macOS (untested but should work)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BluberrySmoothie/DaddyLivePlayer.git
cd DaddyLivePlayer
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install Streamlink
```bash
# Via pip
pip install streamlink

# OR via winget (Windows)
winget install streamlink
```

### 4. Install Video Player

**Option A: MPV (Recommended - lightweight)**
```bash
winget install mpv
```

**Option B: VLC (Alternative)**
```bash
winget install VideoLAN.VLC
```

### 5. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check Streamlink
streamlink --version

# Check MPV
mpv --version

# Check Python packages
pip list | grep -E "PyQt6|selenium|streamlink"
```

## Usage

### GUI Application (Recommended)

Launch the full application with graphical interface:

```bash
python daddylive_gui.py
```

**Features:**
1. **Live Channels Tab** - Browse and search all available channels
2. **Events Schedule Tab** - View upcoming sporting events
3. **Search/Filter** - Type to filter channels or events in real-time
4. **Play/Stop Controls** - Simple playback management

### Standalone Player (Advanced)

If you know the channel ID, you can use the standalone player script directly:

```bash
# Play a specific channel by ID
python PlayTest-streamlink.py <channel_id>

# Examples:
python PlayTest-streamlink.py 32    # Play channel 32
python PlayTest-streamlink.py 20    # Play channel 20
python PlayTest-streamlink.py 349   # Play channel 349
```

**Standalone Player Features:**
- Automatic session cookie extraction
- Network traffic monitoring to find stream URLs
- Supports multiple domain patterns (nfsnew, dokko1new, etc.)
- Automatic MPV/VLC detection with fallback
- Works in headless mode for automation

**Silent Mode (for scripting):**
```bash
python PlayTest-streamlink.py 32 --silent
```

## How It Works

### Session Management
1. Opens the channel webpage using Selenium
2. Extracts session cookies for authentication
3. Passes cookies and URL to Streamlink with proper headers

### Playback
- Streams are handled by Streamlink
- Video playback via MPV (preferred) or VLC
- Automatic header injection (Referer, Origin, User-Agent)
- Cookie-based authentication

## Configuration

### Stream Server Settings
Edit `PlayTest-streamlink.py` to modify default settings:

```python
STREAM_REFERER = "https://truncatedactivitiplay.xyz/"
STREAM_ORIGIN = "https://truncatedactivitiplay.xyz"
BASE_WEBPAGE = "https://dlhd.dad"
```

### Player Selection
The application automatically detects available players in this order:
1. MPV (if found in PATH or common installation directories)
2. VLC (as fallback)

To force a specific player, modify the `find_player()` function in `PlayTest-streamlink.py`.

## Troubleshooting

### "No suitable video player found"
**Solution:** Install MPV or VLC
```bash
winget install mpv
# OR
winget install VideoLAN.VLC
```

### "Streamlink not found in PATH"
**Solution:** Install or reinstall Streamlink
```bash
pip install --upgrade streamlink
```

### "Could not find stream URL"
**Possible causes:**
- Channel is offline or unavailable
- Site structure has changed
- Network connectivity issues
- VPN may be required

**Solutions:**
- Try a different channel
- Check if the website is accessible in a regular browser
- Use a VPN if geo-blocked
- Wait and retry (may be temporary rate limiting)

### "HTTP 418 I'm a teapot" or "HTTP 522" errors
**Possible causes:**
- Server-side anti-bot protection
- Rate limiting
- Server temporarily down
- IP address blocked

**Solutions:**
- Wait a few minutes before retrying
- Use a VPN to change your IP address
- Try different channels (some have less protection)

### Chrome/WebDriver Issues
**Solution:** Update Chrome and reinstall webdriver-manager
```bash
pip install --upgrade webdriver-manager
```

### GUI Crashes or Threading Errors
The latest version includes thread-safe signal handling. If you encounter crashes:
- Make sure you're using the latest code
- Check that PyQt6 is properly installed: `pip install --upgrade PyQt6`

## Known Limitations

- **Stream Availability**: Not all channels work at all times (server-side restrictions)
- **Anti-Bot Protection**: Some channels use 418 errors to block automated access
- **Geo-Restrictions**: Some content may require VPN depending on location
- **Cross-Origin Iframes**: Streams in cross-origin iframes may not be detectable
- **Site Changes**: If the source website changes structure, URL detection may fail
